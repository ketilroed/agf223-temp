    "# Plasma\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Plasma is created when a gas is heated to such a degree that at least one of the electrons in an atom has been stripped free (ionized), leaving behind a positively charge nucleus, called an ion. Plasma is often referred to as the fourth state of matter; solid, liquid, and gas being the three others. Since plasma are made up free charge carriers (ions and electrons), it is subject to influence from electromagnetic fields and forces. Emerging electric fields become rampant everywhere meaning that the particles do not simply collide mechanically, but are affected by the electromagnetic fields between each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plasma usually exist only in vacuum conditions. In air, plasma will cool and electrons and ions will easily recombine into neutral atoms. Plasma is the most abundant form of matter in the visible universe. E.g., plasmas are present in stars (Sun), the solar wind, the Earth's ionosphere, interstella space, nebulas.\n",

They appear in lightning and auroras (ionosphere), or can be man made, by e.g., using electromagnetic fields to partly ionize a gas within a confined volume (Neon or fluorecent light, pixels of a plasma TV, nuclear fusion plasma reactors). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because so much of the universe is made of plasma, its behaviour and properties are naturally of interest to scientists in many disicplines and even for industrial applications. Plasmas are e.g., essential for [producing computer chips](https://uigelz.eecs.umich.edu/pub/intro/computer-chips.pdf). Plasma diagnostic techniques are therefore an important field of study. \n",

    "## Sheath\n",
    "\n",
    "When you introduce a charged object into a plasma it will start to attracted particles of opposite charge. This builds a sheath of opposite charge around the object that balances out the introduced charge. The field of the negativly charged object will not extend beyond the edge of the sheath, and the negatively charge object is effectively **shielded** from the surrounding plasma. \n",

    "In a plasma the Debye length ($\\lambda_D$) is considered a fundamental plasma parameter and describes change in the local potential due to the presence of some charged object, and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k T}{n q^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, k is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the particle temperature, $n$ is the plasma density and $q$ is the particle charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Debye length is a measure for how far the electrostatic effect created by the introduced charge persist in the plasma. With each Debye length the introduced charge is increasingly electrically screened and the electric potential decreases in magnitude by $1/e \\approx 0.368$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria to be called a plasma\n",
    "\n",
    "To be defined as a plasma, an ionized gas must be quasineutral ($n_e \\simeq n_i$) and exhibit a collective behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "While a plasma can contain local concentrations of positive and negative charge which give rise to electric fields, quasineutral means that as a whole the plasma must contain an equal amount of negative and positive charge (on average); the net charge of the plasma is neutral. \n",
    "\n",
    "Motion of charges also generates currents, and hence magnetic fields. These electric and magnetic fields are long range and affect particles even at large distances. Plasma is therefore a collection of charged particles that behave in a collective way because of attractive and repelling electric and magnetic forces. \n",
    "\n",
    "A plasma must also have enough charged particles so that it can act as shield to an external potential. Its volume must be large enough to cover many Debye lengths in each direction. \n",

    "\n",
    "The analysis of the I-V curve will then provide information about the plasma density and temperature. The theory was developed by Mott-Smith and Langmuir in the 1920's [[Mott-Smith and Langmuir, The theory of collectors in gaseous discharges, Phys. Rev. 28, 727, 1926, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.28.727]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.28.727). There is no general theory that applies to all probe geometries and orientations, plasma conditions, and spacecraft designs. Probes are therefore designed for special limiting cases. In this module we consider the orbital-motion-limited (OML) described in Mott-Smith and Langmuir 1926. For this condition, the probe radius must be smaller than the thickness of the sheath that surrounds it ($r_{probe} \\lt \\lambda_D$ ).\n",

    "Consider a neutral object immersed in a plasma. Since electrons are more mobile than ions (higher velocity due to small mass), more electrons than ions will collide with and be collected by the object. The object will therefore aquire a negative charge with respect to the ambient plasma. This will in turn start to attract positive ions and repel electrons, until eventually an equilibrium is reach where the electron current balances the ion current ($I_e = I_i$). \n",

    "The floating potential $V_f$ refers to the potential aquired by an unbiased object relative to the plasma at the equilibrium condition where the electron current is equal to the ion current ($I_e = I_i$). In space, the plasma potential is usually defined to be 0 and thus a spacecraft will aquire a negative floating potential with respect to the plasma.\n",

    "## Electron retardation region ($T_e$)\n",
    "In the region where the probe potential is between the floating potential and the plasma potential, the probe potential is slightly negative relative to the plasma potential. In this region, only electrons with a sufficiently high thermal speed will be collected by the probe. Electrons with a lower thermal speed will be repelled. This is called the electron retardation region, and can be used to characterize the thermal distribution of the electrons, and thus also to determine the electron temperature $T_e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a probe immersed in a plasma will aquire a negative floating potential, a positive bias voltage must be applied to the probe to measure the electron current in this region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the potential difference between the probe and the plasma is reduced (increasing probe bias relative to $V_f$, the electron current will increase exponentially. As mentioned above, when reaching the plasma potential, all the thermal electrons with a direction towards the probe will be collected since no potential barrier exists between the probe and the plasma. \n",
